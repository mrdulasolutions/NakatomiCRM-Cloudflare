"""Find likely duplicate contacts using a short cascade of SQL signals.

Strategies, highest confidence first:

1. **exact_email** — two live contacts share the same email (case-insensitive).
   Score: 1.0. Near-certain duplicate.
2. **name_similar_same_company** — full-name trigram similarity > 0.80 AND
   both contacts point at the same ``company_id``. Score: 0.8. Catches the
   common "Ada Lovelace" ↔ "Ada Lovelacce" case when the company is known.
3. **last_name_same_first_variant** — identical last name (case-insensitive)
   AND first names either match exactly or one is a prefix of the other
   (min length 2). Score: 0.7. Catches "Matt/Matthew", "Chris/Christopher",
   and any long-form-of pair. Does **not** catch "Tom/Thomas" — Thomas
   starts with "Th", not "Tom", so it's a nickname relationship rather
   than a prefix one. We don't try to model nicknames. Trigram on short
   first names is unusable as a signal ("Tom"/"Thomas" = 0.08 similarity).

Pairs are deduplicated across strategies — each (a, b) surfaces once with
the highest score found. Backed by the trigram GIN indexes added in
migration 0006; strategies 1 and 3 are index-friendly even without pg_trgm,
strategy 2 requires it.
